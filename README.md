# Mathtastic Games Apple Addition

This game was created to encourage young individuals to embrace the complex world of mathematics.  Players are able to toggle images and choose the game difficulty.  Players who have an account are able to track their history of “tricky questions” to keep track of their progress.

## Getting Started

In the projectDocs directory, you will find a setup.sql document that will create a “mathtastic” database and enter some information.  You will receive the questions, images, and two test users.  One user will have a history of “tricky questions”, while the other will not.

If you do not already have a user with a password created on MySQL, you will need to create one.
The database.properties file will need to be updated with your username and password.

## Next Steps

When the application is launched, you should be greeted with this:
